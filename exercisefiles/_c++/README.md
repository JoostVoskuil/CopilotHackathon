# Activate GitHub Copilot using C++

Demo project for running labs to evaluate Copilot viability in a C++ environment.

> Make sure GitHub Copilot is configured and enabled, just check your IDE integration settings.

### Exercise 1: Introduction

- Open `server.cpp` and begin by writing a simple C++ "server" logic (or stubs) that replicate the functionality from the original Node.js version. 
- Open `test.cpp` to check basic tests.
- Run `make tests` from the command line to compile and run the tests.

### Exercise 2: Inline suggestions

Use Copilot suggestions to build and expand your C++ server features. For example, implement stubs for:
- /DaysBetweenDates
- /Validatephonenumber
- /ValidateSpanishDNI
...and so on.

### Exercise 3: GitHub Copilot Chat and prompting

Use the chat features to refine and generate additional code or documentation in real time.

### Exercise 4: Refactoring and optimizing

When your code is large, use Copilot to split it into multiple functions or files, and refactor for clarity.

### Exercise 5: Document the code

Ask Copilot to automatically generate comments and documentation for `server.cpp`.

### Exercise 6: Building tests

Leverage Copilot to write tests in `test.cpp` for the features in `server.cpp`.

### Exercise 7: Create a Makefile

Create a Makefile that compiles `server.cpp`, links, and then runs the tests in `test.cpp`.

## Summary

You have converted the Node.js application into a C++ application while still leveraging GitHub Copilot for code completion, documentation, tests, and more.
