## Goal

The goal of a GitHub Copilot Hackathon is to learn how to use it through a set of [exercises (labs)](#labs-instructions). These exercises consist of building a web server using Nodejs with different functionalities, a .NET Web API, or a Java Rest API (either Spring Boot or Quarkus).

We have also set two exercises for data engineers and data scientists based on Python.

For those who are already familiar with GitHub Copilot, we have also defined a series of [challenges](#challenges-instructions) to test your skills. You will find an introduction and short guidance to help you solve the challenge, but you will have to do most of the work on your own (with the help of Copilot, of course).

GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered code assistant that helps developers write better code faster. It uses machine learning models trained on billions of lines of code to suggest whole lines or entire functions based on the context of what youâ€™re working on. By using Copilot, you can learn how to write better code and improve your productivity.

Remember:

- As you type, GitHub Copilot will make suggestions, you can accept them by pressing Tab.
- If nothing shows up after Copilot writes some lines, press enter and wait a couple of seconds.
- Press **Ctrl + Enter**, to see more suggestions.
- Use Copilot chat to support your learning and development.
- Press **Ctrl + i** to start Copilot chat inline within your code. 

## Pre-requisites

**GitHub Copilot access**

If you still do not have an active Copilot license, a 30 day trial can be requested here: https://github.com/github-copilot/signup.

### Work with GitHub Codespaces

Environment is already configured to work with GitHub Codespaces, you can find the configuration files in the `.devcontainer` folder.

To start programming, just start a new codespace. You are ready to go and don't need to install anything.

### IDE Extensions

Please update your IDE to the latest version. This is important to have the best experience with GitHub Copilot.

Install the Copilot Extension for your IDE:

- [Visual Studio Code Copilot Extension](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/getting-code-suggestions-in-your-ide-with-github-copilot?tool=vscode)
- [JetBrains Copilot Extension](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/getting-code-suggestions-in-your-ide-with-github-copilot?tool=jetbrains)

Please note, the extensions are already installed in Visual Studio 2022 if you have a recent version. You need to log in to use them:

- [Visual Studio 2022 Copilot Extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/visual-studio-github-copilot-extension?view=vs-2022)
